      title: 'ðŸ§  My Research ðŸ§²'
      subtitle: ''
      text: My research investigates the organization of brain networks using both functional and structural MRI. On the functional side, I study the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity with methods such as weighted permutation entropy and functional connectivity, aiming to understand how local signal properties relate to large-scale connectivity patterns and how these relationships are altered in neurological disease. I am also interested in extending this work toward dynamical systems and whole-brain modeling, in order to test mechanistic accounts of network behavior.  
      
        
        On the structural side, I apply fractal geometry to describe the irregularity of brain morphology during development and in clinical populations. Fractal dimensionality provides a scale-invariant way to characterize structural form that extends beyond traditional volumetric approaches, offering new perspectives on how the brainâ€™s shape evolves and changes in disease.
        
       
        Looking forward, I am eager to integrate new methods across different spatial and temporal levels of analysis. Linking insights from genetics and microstructure to large-scale dynamics, to gain a deeper understanding of the principles that govern brain function and give rise to phenomenological, cognitive, and behavioral variability.

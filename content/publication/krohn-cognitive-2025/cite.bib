 abstract = {Background and Objectives Cognitive deﬁcits represent a major long-term complication of anti–leucine-rich, gliomainactivated 1 encephalitis (LGI1-E). Although severely aﬀecting patient outcomes, the structural brain changes underlying these deﬁcits remain poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesized a link between white matter (WM) networks and cognitive outcomes in LGI1-E.},

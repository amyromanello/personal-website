abstract: Background Even in the early stages, global crises such as the COVID-19
  pandemic lead to serious dislocations of social life, secondary adjustment reactions
  to external restrictions and individual concerns. Coping mechanisms may also include
  dysfunctional strategies like an increase of drug use. Considering the wide-spread
  use of cannabis, the aim of this study was to elucidate the interplay of social
  restrictions, psychopathology, concerns related to the pandemic in addition to the
  users’ experiences, motivations and consumption quantities during the early COVID-19
  pandemic. It was presumed that cannabis intake would increase during the early phase
  of the crisis and that consumption quantities would be related to corona-related
  restrictions, concerns as well as subjective substance effects and psychopathology.   Materials
  and methods  As part of an international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey
  ( N = 5,049) available in five languages, consumption quantities and patterns of
  cannabis use in the early phase of the pandemic from April to August 2020 were examined.
  Participants retrospectively rated restrictions and concerns related to the pandemic,
  motives of cannabis use prior to and during 1 month the pandemic, and subjective
  consumption effects.    Results Cannabis use behavior showed no significant differences
  when consumption quantities prior and during 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak
  were compared. Higher quantities of cannabis intake prior and during 1 month of
  the pandemic as well as more corona-related concern were associated with an increased
  perception of positive effects of cannabis during the pandemic. Predictors of its
  use during 1 month of pandemic were higher pre-pandemic consumption quantity, older
  age, quarantinization, a lesser degree of being affected by negative effects of
  the pandemic and a stronger subjective experience of corona-related positive effects
  of cannabis. Comparisons of the motives for cannabis intake in the pre-pandemic
  versus the pandemic period showed that all rationales for consumption were reported
  less frequently, except boredom.   Conclusion  Frequencies of cannabis intake remained
  relatively stable in the early pandemic phase. Risk factors for increased use seem
  related to habitual consumption patterns that become more prominent under quarantinization.
  The use of cannabis as a dysfunctional coping strategy might not be amenable via
  self-report and should therefore receive special attention in clinical contexts.

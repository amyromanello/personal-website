 abstract = {Abstract: Aims: Investigation of altered consumption patterns of benzodiazepines and opioids during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study sample was extracted from an international web-based survey provided from April to August 2021 in 5 languages; completed by 5049 participants. A retrospective exploration of sociodemographic features, frequencies and dosages of benzodiazepine and opioid use and psychopathology was executed. Quantities of the respective substance use and consumers’ motivations for consumption pre-pandemic versus during the pandemic were compared. Associations between quantities, psychopathology, and positive effects of the substances, negative sequelae and concerns related to COVID-19 were examined. Results: A significant reduction of the consumption quantity was solely found for heroin users. Higher benzodiazepine consumption rates during the pandemic were marginally associated with a greater general psychopathology. Concerns related to the COVID-19 crisis were significantly positively correlated with the symptomatologies of the opioid and benzodiazepine users who presented a higher perception of life restriction. A significant reduction of reported motivations consumption was found for the motive partying. Conclusions: During the early COVID-19 pandemic the quantities and motives of consumption of sedatives and opioids remained mostly stable. The psychopathology of consumers was associated with specific concerns related to the pandemic.},

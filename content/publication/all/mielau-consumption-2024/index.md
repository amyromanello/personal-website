abstract: 'Abstract: Aims: Investigation of altered consumption patterns of benzodiazepines
  and opioids during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study sample was extracted
  from an international web-based survey provided from April to August 2021 in 5 languages;
  completed by 5049 participants. A retrospective exploration of sociodemographic
  features, frequencies and dosages of benzodiazepine and opioid use and psychopathology
  was executed. Quantities of the respective substance use and consumers’ motivations
  for consumption pre-pandemic versus during the pandemic were compared. Associations
  between quantities, psychopathology, and positive effects of the substances, negative
  sequelae and concerns related to COVID-19 were examined. Results: A significant
  reduction of the consumption quantity was solely found for heroin users. Higher
  benzodiazepine consumption rates during the pandemic were marginally associated
  with a greater general psychopathology. Concerns related to the COVID-19 crisis
  were significantly positively correlated with the symptomatologies of the opioid
  and benzodiazepine users who presented a higher perception of life restriction.
  A significant reduction of reported motivations consumption was found for the motive
  partying. Conclusions: During the early COVID-19 pandemic the quantities and motives
  of consumption of sedatives and opioids remained mostly stable. The psychopathology
  of consumers was associated with specific concerns related to the pandemic.'

abstract: 'Introduction: The current corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has
  caused a serious global health crisis that has affected large parts of the public
  and private life worldwide, including the use of psychoactive substances. In this
  study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of serotonergic
  psychedelics, i.e., the settings in which people use psychedelics, the motives of
  usage, and the subjective quality of psychedelic experiences.   Methods: The study
  was part of an international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey ( N = 5,049)
  available in five languages (English, German, Spanish, Italian, and Korean) carried
  out during the early phase of the pandemic from April to August 2020. Participants
  were asked to retrospectively rate settings and motives of psychedelic substance
  use before the pandemic and in the last 4 weeks during the pandemic, as well as
  changes in psychedelic experiences.   Results: Of n = 1,375 participants that reported
  the use psychedelics in 2019 or 2020, n = 642 (46.6%) also took psychedelics during
  the pandemic. During the pandemic, participants used psychedelics significantly
  less often in settings that were outside their home. Top motives to use psychedelics
  were comparable before and during the pandemic, but participants consumed less out
  of curiosity, to celebrate, or because friends took it, and more out of boredom.
  An increase in positively connoted, often pro-social experiences was observed. Two
  thirds of participants who used psychedelics during the pandemic claimed that psychedelics
  had helped them to deal better with the corona pandemic at least slightly.   Discussion:
  Changes in setting and motives were mostly in line with restrictions caused by control
  measures to contain the spread of the virus. The unexpected increase in positively
  connoted experiences possibly reflects a favorable interaction of environmental
  macro- and individual micro-contexts during the pandemic (e.g., by reducing the
  use in more uncontrolled recreational settings or by encouraging a strong self-selection
  of substance users due to the expectation of “bad trips”). Increased pro-social
  feelings under psychedelics might reflect a desire for social interactions in times
  of social distancing and pandemic-related stress and anxiety.'

abstract: 'Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is presumably having an impact on the
  consumption of psychoactive substances. Social distancing and lockdown measures
  may particularly aﬀect the use of “party drugs” (e.g., stimulants, dissociatives,
  and GHB/GBL) through the absence of typical use settings. We aimed to analyse the
  use patterns of those substances and underlying motivations before and during the
  pandemic. Methods: A subsample of 1,231 users of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine,
  MDMA/ecstasy, cocaine), dissociative drugs (ketamine, dextromethorphan, PCP), and
  GHB/GBL was assessed from 30th April to 4th August 2020 as part of the Corona Drug
  Survey, a cross-sectional international online survey in ﬁve languages that included
  a total of 5,049 participants. The reported use of distinct substances and the underlying
  motivations were ascertained before (retrospectively) and during the pandemic. Furthermore,
  associations between drug use as a coping mechanism, pandemic-related stressors,
  and substance use were examined. Results: Regarding the reported frequency of use
  during the pandemic, 48.0–64.8% of the sample ceased or decreased, 11.9–25.5% maintained,
  and 23.6–29.1% increased their consumption. MDMA/ecstasy showed the strongest decrease
  and GHB/GBL and dissociatives the highest increase. Participants reported that price,
  quality, and supply were mostly unaﬀected by the pandemic. The most common motivations
  before and during the pandemic were mood-related factors, such as a desire to feel
  exhilarated, euphoric, high, or buzzed. The relevance of social purposes and mood-related
  motivators declined during the pandemic, whereas dealing with boredom increased.
  Overall, 16.4–35.6% perceived drug use as helpful for dealing with pandemic-related
  stressors, which were associated with an increased consumption frequency. Conclusion:
  The early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with major changes in the
  use of “party drugs”. Those who increased their level of drug use and perceived
  it as a coping strategy in particular might be targeted with adaptive preventive
  and therapeutic measures.'

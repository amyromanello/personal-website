abstract: 'Background & Aim: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the
  central nervous system associated with deficits in cognitive and motor functioning.
  While structural brain changes such as demyelination are an early hallmark of the
  disease, a characteristic profile of functional brain alterations in early MS is
  lacking. Functional neuroimaging studies at various disease stages have revealed
  complex and heterogeneous patterns of aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in MS,
  with previous studies largely being limited to a static account of FC. Thus, it
  remains unclear how time-resolved FC relates to variance in clinical disability
  status in early MS. We here aimed to characterize brain network organization in
  early MS patients with time-resolved FC analysis and to explore the relationship
  between disability status, multi-domain clinical outcomes and altered network dynamics.
  Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired from 101 MS patients
  and 101 age- and sexmatched healthy controls (HC). Based on the Expanded Disability
  Status Score (EDSS), patients were split into two sub-groups: patients without clinical
  disability (EDSS ≤ 1, n = 36) and patients with mild to moderate levels of disability
  (EDSS ≥ 2, n = 39). Five dynamic FC states were extracted from whole-brain rs-fMRI
  data. Group differences in static and dynamic FC strength, across-state overall
  connectivity, dwell time, transition frequency, modularity, and global connectivity
  were assessed. Patients’ impairment was quantified as custom clinical outcome z-scores
  (higher: worse) for the domains depressive symptoms, fatigue, motor, vision, cognition,
  total brain atrophy, and lesion load. Correlation analyses between functional measures
  and clinical outcomes were performed with Spearman partial correlation analyses
  controlling for age. Results: Patients with mild to moderate levels of disability
  exhibited a more widespread spatiotemporal pattern of altered FC and spent more
  time in a high-connectivity, low-occurrence state compared to patients without disability
  and HCs. Worse symptoms in all clinical outcome domains were positively associated
  with EDSS scores. Furthermore, depressive symptom severity was positively related
  to functional dynamics as measured by statespecific global connectivity and default
  mode network connectivity with attention networks, while fatigue and motor impairment
  were related to reduced frontoparietal network connectivity with the basal ganglia.
  Conclusions: Despite comparably low impairment levels in early MS, we identified
  distinct connectivity alter­ ations between patients with mild to moderate disability
  and those without disability, and these changes were sensitive to clinical outcomes
  in multiple domains. Furthermore, time-resolved analysis uncovered alterations in'

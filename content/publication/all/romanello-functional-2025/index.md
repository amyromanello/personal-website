abstract: 'Functional connectivity (FC) quantifies the temporal coherence of blood-oxygen-level-dependent
  (BOLD) signals across brain regions. Recently, the information-theoretic “complexome”
  framework has linked FC to coinciding ‘complexity drops’: transient moments in which
  regional BOLD signals simultaneously become regular. Here, we replicate this relationship
  in an independent dataset and extend the framework by (i) integrating it with signal
  cofluctuation analysis through edge-timeseries, (ii) extending the previous binary
  concept of simultaneous complexity drops to a continuous, threshold-free calculation,
  (iii) providing evidence of clinical relevance in the model disease of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor
  encephalitis, and (iv) deriving a novel measure of pairwise dissimilarity in local
  BOLD patterns. This ‘index of pattern incongruency’ (IPI) explains clinically relevant
  FC reductions and maps onto novel associations with cognition. These findings show
  that global FC is closely related to local patterns within underlying BOLD signals,
  strengthening the link between complexity dynamics and the brain’s functional organization
  as a large-scale network.'

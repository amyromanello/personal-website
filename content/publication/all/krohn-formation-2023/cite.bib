 abstract = {The neonatal period represents a critical phase of human brain development. During this time, the brain shows a dramatic increase in size, but it remains largely unclear how the morphology of the human brain develops in early post-partum life. Here we show that human newborns undergo a rapid formation of brain shape, beyond the expected growth in brain size. Using fractal analysis of structural neuroimaging data, we show that brain shape (i) strongly reflects infant maturity beyond differences in brain size, (ii) significantly outperforms brain size in predicting infant age at scan (mean error ~4 days), (iii) detects persistent alterations in prematurely born infants that are not captured by brain size, (iv) is consistently more sensitive to genetic similarity among neonates, and (v) is superior in predicting which newborns are twin siblings, with up to 97% accuracy. These findings identify the formation of brain shape as a fundamental maturational process in human brain development.},

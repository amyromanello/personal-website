abstract: The neonatal period represents a critical phase of human brain development.
  During this time, the brain shows a dramatic increase in size, but it remains largely
  unclear how the morphology of the human brain develops in early post-partum life.
  Here we show that human newborns undergo a rapid formation of brain shape, beyond
  the expected growth in brain size. Using fractal analysis of structural neuroimaging
  data, we show that brain shape (i) strongly reflects infant maturity beyond differences
  in brain size, (ii) significantly outperforms brain size in predicting infant age
  at scan (mean error ~4 days), (iii) detects persistent alterations in prematurely
  born infants that are not captured by brain size, (iv) is consistently more sensitive
  to genetic similarity among neonates, and (v) is superior in predicting which newborns
  are twin siblings, with up to 97% accuracy. These findings identify the formation
  of brain shape as a fundamental maturational process in human brain development.

Hi, I'm Amy!  

I'm a doctoral candidate at the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain](https://www.mind-and-brain.de/) and in the [Cognitive Neurology Lab](https://cognitive-neurology.com/) at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. I study resting-state brain dynamics in normative and clinical populations. I'm interested in applying computational methods in the analysis of functional MRI data to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of functional connectivity and variability in BOLD signals. I hold degrees in Behavioral Neuroscience (BSc) and Medical Neuroscience (MSc).  

Outside of academia, I'm an [artist](https://nothingtwoserious.art/), cat mom, and knitter. I'm also involved with harm reduction and health policy reform initiatives both in Germany and abroad.

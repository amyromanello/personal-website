Methods: The study sample was extracted from an international web-based survey provided from April to August 2021 in 5 languages; completed by 5049 participants. A retrospective exploration of sociodemographic features, frequencies and dosages of benzodiazepine and opioid use and psychopathology was executed. Quantities of the respective substance use and consumers’ motivations for consumption pre-pandemic versus during the pandemic were compared. Associations between quantities, psychopathology, and positive effects of the substances, negative sequelae and concerns related to COVID-19 were examined. Results: A significant reduction of the consumption quantity was solely found for heroin users. Higher benzodiazepine consumption rates during the pandemic were marginally associated with a greater general psychopathology. Concerns related to the COVID-19 crisis were significantly positively correlated with the symptomatologies of the opioid and benzodiazepine users who presented a higher perception of life restriction. A significant reduction of reported motivations consumption was found for the motive partying. Conclusions: During the early COVID-19 pandemic the quantities and motives of consumption of sedatives and opioids remained mostly stable. The psychopathology of consumers was associated with specific concerns related to the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background
              Even in the early stages, global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic lead to serious dislocations of social life, secondary adjustment reactions to external restrictions and individual concerns. Coping mechanisms may also include dysfunctional strategies like an increase of drug use. Considering the wide-spread use of cannabis, the aim of this study was to elucidate the interplay of social restrictions, psychopathology, concerns related to the pandemic in addition to the users’ experiences, motivations and consumption quantities during the early COVID-19 pandemic. It was presumed that cannabis intake would increase during the early phase of the crisis and that consumption quantities would be related to corona-related restrictions, concerns as well as subjective substance effects and psychopathology.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              
                As part of an international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey (
                N
                = 5,049) available in five languages, consumption quantities and patterns of cannabis use in the early phase of the pandemic from April to August 2020 were examined. Participants retrospectively rated restrictions and concerns related to the pandemic, motives of cannabis use prior to and during 1 month the pandemic, and subjective consumption effects.
              
            
            
              Results
              Cannabis use behavior showed no significant differences when consumption quantities prior and during 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak were compared. Higher quantities of cannabis intake prior and during 1 month of the pandemic as well as more corona-related concern were associated with an increased perception of positive effects of cannabis during the pandemic. Predictors of its use during 1 month of pandemic were higher pre-pandemic consumption quantity, older age, quarantinization, a lesser degree of being affected by negative effects of the pandemic and a stronger subjective experience of corona-related positive effects of cannabis. Comparisons of the motives for cannabis intake in the pre-pandemic versus the pandemic period showed that all rationales for consumption were reported less frequently, except boredom.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                Frequencies of cannabis intake remained relatively stable in the early pandemic phase. Risk factors for increased use seem related to habitual consumption patterns that become more prominent under quarantinization. The use of cannabis as a dysfunctional coping strategy might not be amenable

	abstract = {Background \& Aim: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system associated with deficits in cognitive and motor functioning. While structural brain changes such as demyelination are an early hallmark of the disease, a characteristic profile of functional brain alterations in early MS is lacking. Functional neuroimaging studies at various disease stages have revealed complex and heterogeneous patterns of aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in MS, with previous studies largely being limited to a static account of FC. Thus, it remains unclear how time-resolved FC relates to variance in clinical disability status in early MS. We here aimed to characterize brain network organization in early MS patients with time-resolved FC analysis and to explore the relationship between disability status, multi-domain clinical outcomes and altered network dynamics.
Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired from 101 MS patients and 101 age- and sexmatched healthy controls (HC). Based on the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), patients were split into two sub-groups: patients without clinical disability (EDSS ≤ 1, n = 36) and patients with mild to moderate levels of disability (EDSS ≥ 2, n = 39). Five dynamic FC states were extracted from whole-brain rs-fMRI data. Group differences in static and dynamic FC strength, across-state overall connectivity, dwell time, transition frequency, modularity, and global connectivity were assessed. Patients’ impairment was quantified as custom clinical outcome z-scores (higher: worse) for the domains depressive symptoms, fatigue, motor, vision, cognition, total brain atrophy, and lesion load. Correlation analyses between functional measures and clinical outcomes were performed with Spearman partial correlation analyses controlling for age.
Results: Patients with mild to moderate levels of disability exhibited a more widespread spatiotemporal pattern of altered FC and spent more time in a high-connectivity, low-occurrence state compared to patients without disability and HCs. Worse symptoms in all clinical outcome domains were positively associated with EDSS scores. Furthermore, depressive symptom severity was positively related to functional dynamics as measured by statespecific global connectivity and default mode network connectivity with attention networks, while fatigue and motor impairment were related to reduced frontoparietal network connectivity with the basal ganglia.
Conclusions: Despite comparably low impairment levels in early MS, we identified distinct connectivity alter­ ations between patients with mild to moderate disability and those without disability, and these changes were sensitive to clinical outcomes in multiple domains. Furthermore, time-resolved analysis uncovered alterations in},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is presumably having an impact on the consumption of psychoactive substances. Social distancing and lockdown measures may particularly aﬀect the use of “party drugs” (e.g., stimulants, dissociatives, and GHB/GBL) through the absence of typical use settings. We aimed to analyse the use patterns of those substances and underlying motivations before and during the pandemic.
Methods: A subsample of 1,231 users of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA/ecstasy, cocaine), dissociative drugs (ketamine, dextromethorphan, PCP), and GHB/GBL was assessed from 30th April to 4th August 2020 as part of the Corona Drug Survey, a cross-sectional international online survey in ﬁve languages that included a total of 5,049 participants. The reported use of distinct substances and the underlying motivations were ascertained before (retrospectively) and during the pandemic. Furthermore, associations between drug use as a coping mechanism, pandemic-related stressors, and substance use were examined.
Results: Regarding the reported frequency of use during the pandemic, 48.0–64.8\% of the sample ceased or decreased, 11.9–25.5\% maintained, and 23.6–29.1\% increased their consumption. MDMA/ecstasy showed the strongest decrease and GHB/GBL and dissociatives the highest increase. Participants reported that price, quality, and supply were mostly unaﬀected by the pandemic. The most common motivations before and during the pandemic were mood-related factors, such as a desire to feel exhilarated, euphoric, high, or buzzed. The relevance of social purposes and mood-related motivators declined during the pandemic, whereas dealing with boredom increased. Overall, 16.4–35.6\% perceived drug use as helpful for dealing with pandemic-related stressors, which were associated with an increased consumption frequency.
Conclusion: The early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with major changes in the use of “party drugs”. Those who increased their level of drug use and perceived it as a coping strategy in particular might be targeted with adaptive preventive and therapeutic measures.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              The current corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a serious global health crisis that has affected large parts of the public and private life worldwide, including the use of psychoactive substances. In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of serotonergic psychedelics, i.e., the settings in which people use psychedelics, the motives of usage, and the subjective quality of psychedelic experiences.
            
            
              Methods:
              The study was part of an international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey (
              N
              = 5,049) available in five languages (English, German, Spanish, Italian, and Korean) carried out during the early phase of the pandemic from April to August 2020. Participants were asked to retrospectively rate settings and motives of psychedelic substance use before the pandemic and in the last 4 weeks during the pandemic, as well as changes in psychedelic experiences.
            
            
              Results:
              Of
              n
              = 1,375 participants that reported the use psychedelics in 2019 or 2020,
              n
              = 642 (46.6\%) also took psychedelics during the pandemic. During the pandemic, participants used psychedelics significantly less often in settings that were outside their home. Top motives to use psychedelics were comparable before and during the pandemic, but participants consumed less out of curiosity, to celebrate, or because friends took it, and more out of boredom. An increase in positively connoted, often pro-social experiences was observed. Two thirds of participants who used psychedelics during the pandemic claimed that psychedelics had helped them to deal better with the corona pandemic at least slightly.
            
            
              Discussion:
              Changes in setting and motives were mostly in line with restrictions caused by control measures to contain the spread of the virus. The unexpected increase in positively connoted experiences possibly reflects a favorable interaction of environmental macro- and individual micro-contexts during the pandemic (e.g., by reducing the use in more uncontrolled recreational settings or by encouraging a strong self-selection of substance users due to the expectation of “bad trips”). Increased pro-social feelings under psychedelics might reflect a desire for social interactions in times of social distancing and pandemic-related stress and anxiety.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity (FC) quantifies the temporal coherence of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across brain regions. Recently, the information-theoretic “complexome” framework has linked FC to coinciding ‘complexity drops’: transient moments in which regional BOLD signals simultaneously become regular. Here, we replicate this relationship in an independent dataset and extend the framework by (i) integrating it with signal cofluctuation analysis through edge-timeseries, (ii) extending the previous binary concept of simultaneous complexity drops to a continuous, threshold-free calculation, (iii) providing evidence of clinical relevance in the model disease of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis, and (iv) deriving a novel measure of pairwise dissimilarity in local BOLD patterns. This ‘index of pattern incongruency’ (IPI) explains clinically relevant FC reductions and maps onto novel associations with cognition. These findings show that global FC is closely related to local patterns within underlying BOLD signals, strengthening the link between complexity dynamics and the brain’s functional organization as a large-scale network.},
